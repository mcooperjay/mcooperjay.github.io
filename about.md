## Background


I am a junior in the Statistics major, Biostatistics emphasis at Brigham Young University. 

I am interested in data science as a way to link datum and utilize learning patterns in a meaningful way. 

With much work, hope and luck, my dream job is to work as a sports statistician. I am also interested in researching more about direct applications of biostatistics, medical statistics, environmental analytics and more.

I have only worked on one project, analyzing home runs per game in differing levels of major, minor and collegiate leagues.
